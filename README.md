# ArmorNet
ArmorNet is primarily designed to detect and prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks in local networks. 
It monitors for ARP spoofing, suspicious SSH sessions, and rogue devices â€” all techniques commonly used in MITM scenarios.
By acting as a lightweight IDS with active defense capabilities, it provides strong first-line protection against lateral movement and session hijacking.
